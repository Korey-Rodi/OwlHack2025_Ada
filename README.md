# Ada Mental Health Chatbot
Hack for OwlHacks Fall 2025
<br>
ADA - Accessibility, Disability, Awareness

# Video Demo

# What is it?
My project is a mental health chatbot that uses a Java Swing GUI to prompt the user for responses and has a comforting bot named Ada reiterate their feelings and direct them to resources if needed. Ada asks the users 3 questions; In one word, describe how you are feeling , How long have these feelings persisted? , Have these feelings made day to day life difficult?. Ada than takes the responses and adds them to a text area, than prompts the user if they need additonal mental health resources. If the user selects yes they are taken to the CDC website for mental health, and if they select no the application closes.

# Why did I make it?
While this project was submitted in the Temple University OwlHack 2025 its main purpose was to introduce myself to java and its libraries and allow me to create my first java project in a proper learning enviroment. The project also follows the Next Frontier Health track of the hackathon where particpants were asked to create a project that "pushes into new frontiers, so should healthcare. Build tools that pivot from the traditional data sets to machine learning/AI solutions to support physical or mental wellness. Develop next-gen health tech where itâ€™s needed most."

# What do I want to add?
As a hackathon is a short term event its no suprise that there is lack of features in the application. I plan on working on this project beyond the event and implementing some key features such as; Reworking the GUI (JavaFX) , Adding AI intergration , a more expansive list of resources , package as an app , backend , among other things. These added features will most definitley make it possible for the project to reach new levels of useability, producutivity and scalability.
